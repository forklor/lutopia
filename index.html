			<h2>The Story, Short</h2>
			
			<p><b>Last Christmas</b> I made my first plush toy as a gift for Tom (my nephew), inspired by a marvelous bird that he drew as he was only 2,5 years old. The Tbird was born.</p>

			<p>He went on drawing, and I continued to give life to the lovely creatures that live in the world of his mind. I was quite glad to discover a new passion, though creating all kinds of things was always a way of life for me.</p>

			<p>These softies are truly unique, hand-made with love, and friendly to nature: most materials are re-used fabrics with natural fibers.</p>

			<p>Enjoy your visit!</p>

			<p>Last, but not least, I would like to thank all my friends who encouraged me to follow this dream :)</p>

			<h3>Update 2011</h3>
			<p class='card'>As far as Tom is concerned, he still draws inspiring creatures and enjoys seeing them come to life. But to our great surprise, there are so many other creative persons out there! Many nice drawings were sent to us with requests to create Lutopians out of them. One young lady had this cool idea to send in her boyfriend's drawing (he drew it 23 years ago, as a child) and she kept it a secret till Christmas - surely you can imagine how thrilled he was to receive this gift :)</p>
